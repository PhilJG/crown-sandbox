# Neurosity Brain Data Visualization

This project connects to a Neurosity headset to visualize brain activity data in real-time. It provides multiple visualization modes to represent different aspects of brain activity, particularly focusing on calm and focus metrics.

## Data Flow

1. **Device Connection**:
   - The backend connects to the Neurosity headset using the `@neurosity/notion` SDK
   - Authentication is handled via device ID, email, and password from the `.env` file

2. **Data Processing**:
   - The backend subscribes to brain activity metrics (calm, focus, etc.)
   - Raw data is processed and normalized
   - Data is broadcast to all connected WebSocket clients

3. **Visualization**:
   - The frontend establishes a WebSocket connection to the server
   - Multiple visualization components can be toggled via the UI
   - Visualizations update in real-time based on incoming brain data

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file with your Neurosity credentials:
   ```
   DEVICE_ID=your_device_id
   EMAIL=your_email@example.com
   PASSWORD=your_password
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## Available Visualizations

### Circle Visualization
The circular visualization provides an intuitive representation of brain activity levels with the following features:

- **Dynamic Sizing**: The circle expands and contracts based on the current probability value (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Color Coding**:
  - Blue (#3498db): High probability (> 0.4) - Calm state
  - Green (#2ecc71): Medium probability (0.3-0.4)
  - Orange (#e67e22): Low probability (0.2-0.3)
  - Red (#e74c3c): Very low probability (< 0.2)
- **Smooth Transitions**: All size and color changes are smoothly interpolated for a natural feel
- **Real-time Feedback**: The current calm percentage is displayed in the center of the circle

### Wave Visualization
Shows brain activity as a dynamic waveform, providing a different perspective on the data.

### Audio Feedback
The application includes an optional audio component that provides real-time sonification of brain activity:

- **Musical Notes**: Maps probability values to musical notes in a pleasant scale
- **Dynamic Volume**: Volume increases with higher probability values
- **Responsive Timing**: Notes are played at regular intervals to prevent audio overload
- **Non-linear Mapping**: The audio response is more sensitive in the middle range (0.2-0.45) to better represent subtle changes in focus/calm states
- **Smooth Transitions**: Notes are played with smooth attack and release to prevent clicking sounds

The audio uses a musical scale from A3 to B5, providing a wide range of pitches that correspond to different activity levels. The mapping is designed to be intuitive, with higher pitches generally indicating higher probability values.

## Dependencies

- Backend:
  - `@neurosity/notion`: Neurosity SDK
  - `express`: Web server
  - `ws`: WebSocket server
  - `dotenv`: Environment variable management

- Frontend:
  - HTML5 Canvas for rendering
  - Vanilla JavaScript (no external frameworks required)

## WebSocket API

### Connecting to the WebSocket Server
Connect to the WebSocket server at:
```
ws://localhost:4000
```

### Available Datasets
To list available datasets, send:
```json
{
  "type": "getDatasets"
}
```

### Selecting a Dataset
To select a dataset, send a WebSocket message with the dataset index:
```json
{
  "type": "selectDataset",
  "datasetIndex": 1
}
```

### Data Format
Once a dataset is selected, you'll receive data points in this format:
```json
{
  "type": "calm",
  "data": {
    "probability": 0.75,
    "timestamp": "12:34:56 PM",
    "emoji": "ðŸŸ¢",
    "rawValue": 0.75
  }
}
```

## Usage

1. Start the server: `node index.js`
2. Connect to the WebSocket server at `ws://localhost:4000`
3. Select a dataset by sending a `selectDataset` message with the desired index
4. Observe the real-time data stream with color-coded emoji indicators

### Emoji Legend
- ðŸŸ¦ (Blue): Very high probability (â‰¥0.9)
- ðŸŸ¢ (Green): High probability (0.75-0.9)
- ðŸŸ£ (Purple): Medium-high probability (0.6-0.75)
- ðŸŸ¡ (Yellow): Medium probability (0.45-0.6)
- ðŸŸ  (Orange): Medium-low probability (0.3-0.45)
- ðŸ”´ (Red): Low probability (<0.3)
